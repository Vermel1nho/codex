# 📚 Study Plan – Block 1: TCP/IP Fundamentals + OSI Layers (0h – 30h)

## 🎯 Goal
Build a strong foundation in the OSI and TCP/IP models and their related protocols. Learn how to test connectivity, identify open ports, and run basic network services.

---

## 📅 Timeline (3 Weeks | ~10h/week)

---

## 🔹 Week 1 (0h – 10h)

### 🎓 Theory (5h)
- [ ] Study the OSI model (7 layers) – functions of each layer  
- [ ] Study the TCP/IP model (4 layers) – comparison with OSI  
- [ ] Understand encapsulation and data flow  
- [ ] Learn about the IP protocol: addressing, routing, subnet masks  

### 💻 Practice (5h)
- [ ] Use the commands: `ping`, `traceroute`  
  - [ ] Test routes to domains like `google.com`, `8.8.8.8`, `github.com`  
- [ ] Identify latency, hops, and packet loss  
- [ ] (Optional) Set up a lab with two VMs and test connectivity between them  

---

## 🔹 Week 2 (10h – 20h)

### 🎓 Theory (5h)
- [ ] Understand TCP vs UDP – practical differences  
- [ ] Learn about ICMP – its role in troubleshooting  
- [ ] Understand ports, sockets, and application layer protocols  

#### Common services to study:
- [ ] SSH (22)  
- [ ] HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)  
- [ ] FTP (21)  
- [ ] DNS (53)  

### 💻 Practice (5h)
- [ ] Use `netstat -tulnp` and `ss -tuln` to list listening ports  
- [ ] Map active services on the system  
- [ ] Use `telnet <ip> <port>` to test port connectivity  
- [ ] (Optional) Simulate TCP vs UDP using tools like `ncat`  

---

## 🔹 Week 3 (20h – 30h)

### 🎓 Review & Consolidation (4h)
- [ ] Review all topics using diagrams or mind maps  
- [ ] Create a visual summary: OSI x TCP/IP + key protocols  
- [ ] Quiz yourself with flashcards or notes  

### 💻 Final Project (6h)
- [ ] Run a local server using `python3 -m http.server`  
  - [ ] Access it via local IP  
- [ ] Test connectivity from another device (or VM)  
- [ ] Observe activity with `netstat`/`ss`  
- [ ] Document the process (optionally in your GitHub repo)
