Track/Lab: Jr Penetration Tester - Content Discovery (Completed), Subdomain Enumeration (Completed), Authentication Bypass (Started)  
Activities: Finished "Content Discovery" room using automated discovery with ffuf; ran `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http://10.10.143.163/FUZZ` but it failed due to missing SecLists; AI suggested using `ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.10.143.163/FUZZ`, which worked and found hidden content; completed "Subdomain Enumeration" room; started "Authentication Bypass" room as "Vermel1nho"  
Tools/Commands: `ffuf` for content discovery  
Challenges: Initial ffuf command failed due to missing SecLists; resolved with AI help by switching to dirb wordlist; heavy day impacted study time  
Results: Successfully discovered hidden web content, learned subdomain enumeration, and began exploring authentication bypass techniques  
Breakdown:  
- Content Discovery: 20 min  
- Subdomain Enumeration: 25 min  
- Authentication Bypass: 20 min
