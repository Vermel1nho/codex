Summary:
I set up a Kali Linux virtual machine on VirtualBox with 6GB RAM and 40GB storage, using the 2025.1 ISO. 
After a failed first attempt due to a Python installation issue, I reinstalled everything successfully.
I configured the hostname to "vbox-kali-linux" and tested basic shell commands like cd, pwd, and whoami. 
This hands-on experience boosted my confidence in using Kali for upcoming Red Team labs.

Next step:
Complete TryHackMeâ€™s Linux Fundamentals module, applying each command directly in the VM.
