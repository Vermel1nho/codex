## --- Direction Shift ---

Marked a strategic shift toward **Red Teaming**, focusing on:
- Active Directory Pentest  
- Social Engineering  
- Privilege Escalation  
- Lateral Movement  
- Detection Evasion

Filtered out non-priorities like deep web hacking; improved clarity and motivation.

## --- Today’s Activity: TryHackMe Jr. Pentester Path ---

**Burp Suite Module (80 min):**  
- Completed 4x 20-minute sessions  
- Skimmed technical parts since web hacking isn’t a main focus  
- Learned basics: proxy, interception, repeater

**Network Security Module (started):**  
- Intro to Nmap and network enumeration  
- Essential for AD pentest and Red Team

## --- Reflection and Plan ---

Using TryHackMe Jr. Pentester Path as an **informative base** — aiming for broad knowledge without getting lost in irrelevant topics.

### Future Focus:
1. **Networks:** TCP/IP, subnetting, Wireshark, Nmap  
2. **Operating Systems:** Linux (bash, permissions), Windows (CMD, PowerShell, AD)  
3. **Python:** Scripting for enumeration and automation  

Then: dive into Red Team labs and advanced topics.

## --- Daily Summary ---

**Hours Today:** ~1.5h (Burp + Network Intro)  
**Cumulative Total:** 70.5 hours toward 10,000  
**Next Steps:** Continue Network Security module; finish path informatively; revisit basics afterward
