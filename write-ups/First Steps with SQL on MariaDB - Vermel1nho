Summary:
I installed MariaDB on my Kali VM and created a database called site_vulneravel with a users table filled with dummy accounts.
I ran basic queries using SELECT, simulated login filtering, and practiced SQL Injection (OR 1=1, LIKE, UNION). 
The query UNION SELECT 1, 'hacked', 'by_vermel1nho', 'pentest'; simulated fake data injection.
This was a key hands-on step in learning how to exploit databases for pentesting.
